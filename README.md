Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and cardholders, leading to significant 
financial losses and security issues. With the increasing volume of digital transactions, traditional rule-based systems are becoming less effective.
To overcome this challenge we designed and implemented a machine learning solution to identify fraudulent credit card transactions 
within a dataset of European cardholder transactions. 
Achieved accurate classification of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, 
contributing to enhanced security and reduced financial losses for both financial 
institutions and cardholders.
